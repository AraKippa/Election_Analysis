# Election_Analysis
PyPoll Mod 3

The purpose of this election audit analysis was to find an automated (coding) way to tabulate the votes quickly. accurately and efficiently, by using Python.

In this congressional electio there were 369,711 votes cast in this election across three Colorado counties.
This [image] (https://github.com/AraKippa/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Capture.PNG) shows a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county.
Denver county had the largest number of votes, by a significant margin.
Diana DeGette had the highest percentage of votes with 73.8%, her next nearest competitor Charles Stockham trailed with 23.0%, with Raymon Doane coming last at 3.1% of counted votes.
Diane DeGette is the candidate who won the election, with 272,892 total votes which was 73.8% of the popular vote counted.

The flexibility of counting and analyzing votes this way is its flexibility.  We could compute the votes per county for each candidate.  We could bring in population statistics to try and see why both Jefferson and Arapahoe were poorly represented.  Is it just a population issue?
